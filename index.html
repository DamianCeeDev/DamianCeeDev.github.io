      <h1>Damian Cee GitHub Webpages</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Thank you for visiting this page. This webpage is meant to showcase my Web Development projects. A lot of
          these
          are mostly for practice and some of these are projects I'm working on. This web page will evolve as I learn
          more
          on my Web Development journey. A lot of what you see here in terms of webpages or websites are integrated with
          my <a href="https://github.com/DamianCeeDev">Github profile.</a> Feel free to visit to see the source code of
          these projects as well as other things I'm
          working on that may not be Web Development related.</p>
